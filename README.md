## Description
Creating an open source project on Github is al
ways time consuming and challenging. It is extremely important to be able to crea
te an in-depth README file so users can appropriately navigate through your proje
ct. This README generator is able to provide that functionality and aid with the 
process. Your README should always include what the project is for, how to use th
e project, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. 
Being able to generate this file through command line makes it easy and you're 
able to spend more time working on your project.

* VS Code 
* GitBash
* Node.js

1. Copy Link: Hit the "Code" button within this GitHub repo to copy link
2. Clone: Within GitBash, use the command "git clone paste link here"
3. NPM: Use the command "npm init -y" to install Node Package Manager
4. Inquirer: Use the command "npm install inquirer" to get npm's inquirer package

## Usage
